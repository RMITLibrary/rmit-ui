## Getting started

Guidance is from [here](https://www.rmit.edu.au/staff/service-connect/facilities-technology/digital-services-brand/brand). 

An incomplete resource, this is a work in progress.

The base style can be copied from [this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMITLibrary/rmit-ui/main/docs/main.css) as the most up to date version ready to publish. New versions of styles as they are developed will appear at this persistent URL.

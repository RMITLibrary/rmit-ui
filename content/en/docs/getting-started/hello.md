As each element is mapped and coded to a Bootstrap element, it will appear in the 'compenents' menu on the left of this screen. At this time limited components are available. 

### Why Bootstrap (5/4/3)?

Bootstrap is a very popular, stable and well documented front-end frame work with excellent accesibility controls built in. As such, it offers a huge development savings for projects.

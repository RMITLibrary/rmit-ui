## Hello

This UI kit has is to assist with Web based projects that rely on common frontend frameworks. As it develops, it will provide css files that will serve RMIT User Interface elements and compile theme here.

[Compiled css file](link)

As each element is mapped and coded to a Bootstrap element, it will appear in the 'compenents' menu on the left of this screen. At this time limited components are available. 

### Why Bootstrap (5/4/3)?

Bootstrap is a very popular, stable and well documented front-end frame work with excellent accesibility controls built in. As such, it offers a huge development savings for projects. Instructure Canvas, RMIT's Learning Management system relies on a version of Bootstrap 3, many Bootstrap 3 conventions are also emplyed in RMIT's primary CMS, Adobe Experience Manager.

RMIT's own Brand guidlines conform very well with the Bootstrap grid system.

### Ok, thanks.

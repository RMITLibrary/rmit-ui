## Getting started

Guidance is from [here](https://www.rmit.edu.au/staff/service-connect/facilities-technology/digital-services-brand/brand). 

An incomplete resource, this is a work in progress.

The base style can be copied from [this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMITLibrary/rmit-ui/main/docs/main.c37d60e0839221f065666bae44ecdc9497f1368f3331e7ce77b403ee390d24996c22f749f0859b7b6ba7b86d9be80b32265d92cef2e9be953a869c7a33553abe.css) as the most up to date version ready to publish.
